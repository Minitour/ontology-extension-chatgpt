Context:
Mindfulness-based stress reduction: Mindfulness-based
clinical interventions combine meditation exercises with
psychoeducational elements, cognitive-behavioural interventions
and movement exercises. The core practices are
sitting meditation with breath awareness and focused
attention, awareness of sensations in the body (body scan),
yoga exercises (e.g. hatha yoga, mindful movement),
walking meditation and insight meditation. The two most
used mindfulness-based clinical interventions in oncology
are mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).
MBSR is a specific multimodal programme focused on
improving well-being and health. It has been used as an
intervention for cancer patients. A meta-analysis showed
the effects of MBSR on the mental health of cancer patients
(Cohen’s effect size d ¼ 0.18).88 Documented benefits after
programme participation include improvements in:
 stress;
 mood;
 anxiety;
 depressive mood;
 sleep;
 fatigue;
 psychological functioning;
 psychosocial adjustment;
 stress reduction;
 enhancements in coping and well-being symptoms;
 QoL;
 fear of recurrence.
